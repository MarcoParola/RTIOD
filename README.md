## Information

[RWS@WACV2026](https://vap.aau.dk/rws/) introduces a new challenge on Robust Thermal-Image Object Detection using the LTDv2 dataset, benchmarking multi-object detection under long-term thermal drift. Real-world conditions like ambient changes, sensor aging, and weather dynamics cause performance degradation, especially in thermal imagery, which relies on shape cues and temperature differentials.

Challenge dataset: LTDv2

Challenge descritpion: [RTIOD@WACV2026]()

A starting kit to run some baseline experiments with YOLO is available [here](doc/starting_kit/README.md), but feel free to reimplement from scratch all the code ;)
