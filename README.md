## Information

[RWS@WACV2026](https://vap.aau.dk/rws/) introduces a new challenge on Robust Thermal-Image Object Detection using the LTDv2 dataset, benchmarking multi-object detection under long-term thermal drift. Real-world conditions like ambient changes, sensor aging, and weather dynamics cause performance degradation, especially in thermal imagery, which relies on shape cues and temperature differentials.

The challenge will be run on Codabench. Rules and objectives on the Codabench challenge [official page](https://www.codabench.org/competitions/10954/).

Challenge dataset: **LTDv2** [paper](https://www.techrxiv.org/doi/full/10.36227/techrxiv.175339329.95323969) [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/vapaau/LTDv2)

A starting kit to run some baseline experiments with YOLO is available [here](doc/starting_kit/), but feel free to reimplement from scratch all the code ;)
